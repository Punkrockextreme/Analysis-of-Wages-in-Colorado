# Analysis-of-Wages-in-Colorado


Analysis of wages in Colorado is a Capstone Project developed during Data Science Career Track at Springboard (2018)

It contains 5 files:

1. 'Analysis of Crimes in the City of New York - Capstone Project 1 - Report - Springboard 2018.pdf' - a report describing the project and its outcomes in detail
2.'Analysis of Crimes in The City of New York - Capstone Project 1 - Presentation - Springboard 2018.pdf' - a slide presentation of the report 
3.'Analysis of Crimes in The City of New York  - Capstone Project 1 - Code - Springboard 2018.ipynb' - a code used to develop the outcomes of the report
4 'Analysis of Crimes in The City of New York  - Capstone Project 1 -Demographics Data Wrangling Code - Springboard 2018.ipynb' - a code used to transform demographics data set
5. 'Analysis of Crimes in The City of New York  - Capstone Project 1 - NYPD Data Set Wrangling Code - Springboard 2018.ipynb' - a code used to clean NYPD data

Cleaned Datasets to be run with the code are available at

4. DATA WRANGLING - wrangling procedures performed on the original dataset
5. DATA EXPLORATION - exloratory analysis of the datasets
6. CRIME RATES	- analysis of NYC crime rates
7. CRIME DENSITY - analysis of crime density 
8. CRIME RATES AND POPULATION - relationship between crime rates and population
9. CRIME HOMOGENEITY - comparison of different fractions (area, population, crime rate) among boroughs
10. CRIME STATUS ANALYSIS - analysis of crime rates of different level
11. CRIME RATES AND HOUSING MARKET - analysis of relationship between crime rates and housing market in NYC
12. DATA MODELING (SUPERVISED LEARNING)	- Linear regression model for relationship between severe crime rates and different demographic indicators
13. DATA MODELING (UNSUPERVISED LEARNING) - study of clustering in the dataset involving: 
	?SIMILARITIES BETWEEN BOROUGHS - cosine similarities between boroughs
	?PRECINCT SEGMENTATION - methods to investigate clustering among precincts using:
	?	T-DISTRIBUTED STOCHASTIC NEIGHBOR EMBEDDING	
	?	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS	
		CLUSTERING METHODS	
	SIMILARITIES BETWEEN PRECINCTS (TOOL) a tool to find out the top most similar precinct and the most contributing crimes 
14. ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS	- limitations of the analysis
15. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE WORK	- recommendation for the next steps
16. CONCLUSIONS - summary of the analysis
